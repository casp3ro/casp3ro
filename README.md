Software engineer and creator with experience in full-stack development, cloud computing, and blockchain technology.
I am goal-oriented and business-driven, dedicated to delivering innovative solutions that accelerate startup growth.

Currently working as a Software Engineer at [Screen Studio](https://screen.studio/).

Previously, I worked as a developer at a company specializing in blockchain and cloud solutions.

I was also involved in the open-source project, [TryQuiet](https://github.com/TryQuiet/quiet), which focuses on encrypted peer-to-peer team chat based on Tor without servers.

After hours, I experiment extensively with AI technology, including RAG, MCPs, agents, neural networks etc.
